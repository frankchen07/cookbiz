We've all got jobs and aspirations. We all have friends to catch up with. Activities after work. Family to see. Side projects, hobbies, packed calendars, all on a dwindling, limited time schedule. 

What's the one commonality? 

**Eating. We all eat.** We put stuff in our mouths, swallow, and hopefully it's not microwaveable Hot Pockets all the time. 

"But I don't have time to cook," you say. That's what I said.

I found cooking when I was in college, subliminally reinforced by years of my mother's cooking. Being semi-continuously homesick, home-cooked food was always greatly appreciated. Of course, it was humble beginnings in the kitchen - burning shit, under-seasoning, and plain ol' debauchery. However, from over-worked student to time-crunched professional, I somehow found my way around the kitchen, and after all these years, have much to share. 

**Come, stay, and cook with me. Pick up on the mindset, habits, and skills that'll draw you into the kitchen time after time.**
