* random topic ideas below

I eat out, don't get me wrong. I do it for the food (obviously), but also for the experience of the restaurant's ambiance. I do it for the people sitting across from me. I enjoy my food and in the meantime, catch up with old friends. Food provides me sustenance, an experience, and learning. 

As I've gotten to be a more proficient cook, I find that some of the food I make actually tastes better than restaurant food. It takes more and more as I learn more to impress me when I go out. 

This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Being a prolific and proficient cook at home has its advantages. Raw ingredients become less daunting. Supermarket visits become a source of interest and joy rather than a disaster scramble. "Hm, let's try this" replaces "I'm bored of my food."

I can't pinpoint exactly when I started cooking. I remember being in a temporary apartment in Westwood, Los Angeles, thinking I could make myself some fried rice. It was pretty mediocre. I sort of made some rice, steamed some random vegetables and chicken, and sort of threw it together with some oil and soy sauce. 

This was right before I tried being vegetarian (it lasted only a year), but it forced me to really consider what I ate. It forced me to create my own meals, be in the kitchen.


* but what happens if you just don't want to cook? that you're the type of person to not give a shit? 

cooking is a life skill, just like any other. It's not your job to convince the person that they should or have to cook. They have to have just the slightest desire for learnings to happen.

* developing that sense of urgency 

developing fluid movements and techniques, making it so your interval times is synced with cooking. Constraints and deadlines impact your cooking. Blue Apron and similar services help recipe and ingredients provide the proving grounds for skills development but does not actually provide the optimizations for fast cooking.

* knife skills

practice practice practice. 5 minutes a day, find a vegetable that isn't hard to chop. I suggest a sharp knife and a zucchini. fingers in, guide the knife using your knuckle

* course planning, recipe planning? fuck that

plan it like your wardrobe. Keep it minimal. Keep things in the fridge that go well together. Veggie, starch, meat. A solid dinner doesn't necessarily have to have cohesion between courses. Kale with garlic, pork with rosemary, and olive oil potatoes might not necessarily go together on a plate, but it doesn't mean you can't eat all three in one go. Treat each vegetable as if it is on its own. salt, acid, oil and steam if necessary. 

* seasoning, oil, salt, acid

kosher salt is your best friend. If you decide to learn anything, learn to salt correctly, oil correctly, and acid correctly. Understand when to add acid and when to add sugar, and you're set to go.

* clean up

soaping dishes for two people takes approximately 3 minutes, even with lots of dishes. This is the sense of urgency that I was talking about. Rinse, 2 minutes. One and done, 5 minutes.

* habit stuff 

The transition was slow. The habit was developed slowly, but my focus wasn't on the physical acts of cooking. It was self-centered. It was focused on me. What did I want to eat? How did I want to eat it? I began with just sustenance. Needing to feed myself a certain way. My vegetarianism didn't last long. My health began to deteriorate and I eventually gave in to eating saltier, fattier, and meatier foods. 

This began a journey of health - I found particular lifestyles that fit me - all this time, I had particular dietary restraints (did I mention that this was a very experimental time for me?) The switchover happened sometime during the last two years of my college career. If I was going to be in the kitchen, I was going to make the food taste good. Trying new places to eat, slowing down, and really enjoying mealtimes was what tied me to cooking culture. I could make food. In some instances, I could make it better than what I could go across the street to get. I was healthier for it. 

I would cook nightly, and my meals would always range from meat, to some vegetables, a side salad, and a starch source. This simple algorithm allows for many options, but removes the decision making process and increases the chance that you'll step into the kitchen. 

This allows the development of the habit of cooking so that it is the norm, not the path that takes the most energy. The point of inputs is to get the person to cook and produce a meal that is delicious and pretty much faster than picking up the phone and ordering something. You get to control how you salt, oil, and put into your food. You taste as you go, and that provides the freedom to make it how you want it to taste. Using the same amount of time, and most likely a similar amount of effort, save money, practice a valuable skill, and get a home cooked meal.



Notice that I don't use a recipe. That is totally fine. Use the recipe to get flavor ideas, but there isn't a need to follow it to the word. 

I look at a recipe such as this one, and I end up writing something like this:

It's the ingredients, and the ordered process that I use, written in shorthand. It's the method that I understand, and eventually, you will too. Remember that delicious meals do not need to be complicated, and several techniques and concepts will put you there 80% of the way. 

Use all of your senses - move like a chef. 

* finding balance

* motivation in the early stages

* lifelong benefits
