It's most likely true that your chopping isn't fast or uniform enough, that you're probably not holding the knife right, therefore your meal never turns out right, so you overcook the wild salmon, burn the broccoli, and now have drawn the conclusion that it's always going to be a disaster, so cooking dinner on a busy weeknight probably isn't a great route to take.

Before you put that thought away (and breathe), **my argument to you is not to talk about technique and the nitpicky details about burning your food, it is to align your mindset so that you're more open to cook, regardless of technique.** As an indirect side effect, your technique will most likely get better. That being said, you won't find any written words in this post about how to hold a knife and make a brunoise dice. That's a fucking terrible topic to write about.

Let's talk about kitchen performance anxiety. If I were to describe it, it would take its form as a certain clumsiness and an awkwardness in movement. There's organizational skills, the handling of pots and pans, and knife work - all of which require dexterous fingers, precise movements, and a fluidity that is described as the "urgency" of a true cook. "He/she moves like a chef," is the quote that comes to mind. The moving image in your head is something you probably saw on YouTube a week ago, of a seasoned, famous chef fluidly moving in kitchen through the fires, chopping furiously, all the while shouting commands and keeping the restaurant afloat. 

To some extent, that colors our expectations of ourselves. We all eat out at delicious restaurants. We've seen the Food Network shows. We've seen plates topped with micro-greens and vibrant sauces with meticulously positioned lamb chops. When our output and feelings don't measure up, we form unconscious expectations when we think about our knife skills, how something we made tasted, and what others thought of your food. Just by saying or just thinking it, the expectation has formed. 

One of the more dangerous things to do when starting out as a blooming home cook is to compare one's own result to some professionally photographed recipe result, to something you ate at a restaurant last week, or to that fluidly-moving chef above. Leave professional pictures, complex recipes, and super-fluid movements for the professional cook (for now). We're just trying to have a nice, home cooked weeknight meal. 

To hammer home that point, understand that you most likely do not have superb photo-lighting or extreme pixel-discipline to make your home-cooked dishes look like they're fucking glistening off the plate. Also you don't attain a serious level of heat in a home kitchen stove, compared to a commercial stove - that's also a constraint. Also, I forgot to mention that you don't have a meat cook, a vegetable cook, fish station, and two people plating for you. Oh, and, all of these people have had 5+ years of experience working 364 days a year (minus Christmas), 16 hours a day, burning the hairs of their arms off. 
Your purpose and direction in YOUR kitchen at this very moment, is different. Take your current skill level and do what you can in the time period alloted. No one starts off as a hyper proficient cook. Most start off a little clumsy, they cut themselves, burn some food, under cook the meat, and obliterate the vegetables. Your first couple meals will be okay - decent and good enough to nosh on, and that, for the time being, is your bar. 

**The point of all that writing, and what you should come away with is: get into the correct head space. Be open to yourself.** You're not lowering standards; you are setting no expectations, seeing where things land, and looking up from there. There's a place in the kitchen for everyone - take action rather than letting the extremes creep into your mind.

So how do you "look up?" By failing. Failure is feedback. This is vital to continually raising the bar in your cooking game. **I'll repeat it again because it's so important. Failure is feedback.**

I often finish cooking my meal, and take mental (or real paper) notes of what tastes off, what looks off, what feels off, and what smells off. Get used to taking some mental observations. At this point, you may not know what you don't know (e.g "your sauce is too thin", or "you didn't balance out the acidity of the tomatoes", or "the kale tastes like stale socks" - whatever). It doesn't matter that you don't know. It matters that you make the observation. They don't have to be complex observations, either. If I want to describe my kale as it tasting like feet, I will. Take it down, and Google it later for five minutes. I guarantee Googling "my sauce is like snot," or "my tomatoes burned the skin off my mouth" will result in something you should be doing differently next time. And next time, you will do it. 

Look at that, the bar just got higher. 

I don't berate myself for mistakes, nor do I distrust my own sense of taste. Nor should you. You taste what you taste, not what you think others want you to taste. This is how you develop a palate, a style, that "feeling" in cooking. You trust yourself. If it's bitter or too salty, you will know. If not now, then later.

Continually raising the bar means working on your skills, one at a time. When you become a really good cook, it's almost like conducting an orchestra. You've got the timing, the methods and manipulations of heat, the precise and quick knife work, the searing, the creation and layering of flavor, and the balance of taste at the end. However, it doesn't matter until it becomes a part of you, which means, a little bit of work everyday.

**Every time you cook, have in mind one concept that you want to focus on.** Is it curling of the fingers while chopping really fast? Getting the seasoning just right for one dish? Steaming to perfection? Do it once, and you know you can do it again. Combined with that fine observational sense of yours, and you're already on your way. You can always build in more complexity later. When things are simple and directional, it's clear what you're working on and what things should taste like. There's nothing to hide behind. 

**Three concepts for you:**

1. Get into the right mental space. 
2. Be agnostic in your observations. Failure is feedback.
3. One skill per meal.
