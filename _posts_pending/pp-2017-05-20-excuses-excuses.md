- what are you excuses for not cooking?
- instead of saying and using the excuse and calling it as it is, take it and sit with it, and question it down to first principles

- what about it do you really not like
- what is the honest truth about why you're not cooking
- whats the real reason behind the excuse? is it the consequence?

- lets systematically break down the barriers so that you can dismantle your excuses
- what is your action-oriented counter to your excuse 
- what is the worse that could happen

- is it really the preparation and the loss of time? are you managing your other time effectively (could be offending to some)
- think about the consequences in terms of your ultimate goal, your excuses may not be helping that, understand that
- what are you excuses based off of
- when are you going to start
- yes its true, we don't know what every time in the kitchen is going to be like

Are your excuses for not cooking dinner making you a takeout bitch? Somewhere in your early days of cooking, sometime even this week, or even today, as you're reading this post, you've given the some kind of excuse for why you didn't pull out the pots and pans.

"I'm interested in reicpes but they never turn out the way that I want them to turn out."

"I work 60-80 hours a week (own my own business) and as much as I enjoy cooking, all the prep work is just too much for me"

"I never know what I'll feel like eating from day to day (or even hour to hour) so planning ahead isn't useful, much less cooking."

"I don't have time, I don't like to wash dishes, and I definitely don't like grocery shopping."

"It often seems like hours of preparation and cleanup go into a meal that's over in a matter of minutes."

"I never learned how to cook, no one ever taught me."

"I always burn everything in the kitchen."




* "interested in recipes but they never turn out the way that I want them to turn out"
* "but the drive-thru is basically the greatest culinary invention of the 20th century"

"even if the meal only took 30 minutes, that's 30 minutes where I need to be fully engaged in the process of prep and cooking. So, even if its a super fast recipe, I still need to actually spend that time cooking as opposed to hopping on grubhub and clicking three buttons and spending the 40 minutes I wait doing whatever I want"

* "I don't have time, I don't like to wash dishes, I never learned how to cook, I don't like grocery shopping, I hate looking for recipes and never know what to cook, I don't know the proper techniques, I'm just a bad cook, it's in my blood, I tried to cook once and it came out terrible, my kitchen is too small,

* "you know how long it takes to clean and chop a bellpepper? I was cooking the simplest things on my diet and it still took a lot of time. I really do enjoy cooking but when you're tired the last thing you want to do is chop veggies"
* "planning a meal takes time, shopping takes time, food preparation takes time, serving takes time, washing dirty dishes takes time"
* "cooking takes up a lot of willpower"
* "I suspect that the main reason is the problem of getting started."

* "I don't like to cook on a regular basis. It takes a lot of time to buy ingredients, cook, and cleanup.
