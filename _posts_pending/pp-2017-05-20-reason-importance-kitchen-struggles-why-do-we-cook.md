- why do we cook

From the simplest of meals to the most complex, we toil in the kitchen, day after day, night after night. For many, the toil isn't worth the benefit, and thus, we allow our cooking skills to die, along with our weeknight dinners. 

You're right about several things:

1. Meals don't cook themselves.

2. Cooking takes time, whether you like it or not.

3. When you cook, there is preparation and clean up involved. 

4. There will be meals where you epically fuck up.

Think long and hard about those 

However, there are benefits of cooking, and the reason are just as numerous. I hear them all the time:

1. I cook what I want, when I want, and how I want.

2. I lead a healthier life through cooking.

3. I save lots of money eating at home.

4. I love making delicious meals for my girlfriend/boyfriend/husband/wife/partner/roommates.

5. I find making dinner to be relaxing.


the skill required is just to be present in the kitchen

truly custom meals to your preference don't make themselves

eating at home can drastically cut costs

cooking as a romantic gesture, you're providing, something you've worked on, toiled over, that will eventually become part of someone (yeah I know it sounds a little bit creepy)

I state again the only prerequisite of cooking is actually be in the kitchen. How do we establish the rationale behind these reasons that overpower the first pains that we have about pulling out pots and pans?
