We all have nostalgic memories of home cooked meals, made by our mothers and fathers. First would be the smell. The smell that wafts into your olfactory senses, evoking powerful memories of when you were child. That was how you felt. You felt comforted, the food was hot and delicious, and you would experience that multiple times throughout your childhood. 

On the flipside, some people have never had a good relationship when it came to food at home. Either way, these food experiences stick with us, and define our tastes, whether good or bad. 

These are the emotions that we feel when we're young. You may or may not have been invited into the kitchen (I for one, distinctly remember my mother iterating that the kitchen was a relatively dangerous place to be). I wasn't necessarily thrown out, but I observed from a distance how my mother cooked. You might not have any real kitchen memories, just the amazing or absolutely disgusting food that you encountered at home. 

Regardless of whether your experience was good or bad, one universal thing happened (if you lived any semblance of a modern, contemporary life). We started eating out more. Restaurant food was good. It was different. It tasted great. So did fast food.
