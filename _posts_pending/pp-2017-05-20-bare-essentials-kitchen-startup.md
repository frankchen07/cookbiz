- kitchen startup analogy
- focus on cooking
- focus on habit creation
- not a focus on technique (yet)
- not a focus on fancy cookware

What do you think when you imagine an early tech startup in Silicon Valley? If you were to describe just the business in one descriptor, what would you describe it as?

Lean. 

Think about it. You've got a handful of people, and each of those individuals play a critical role in the company. Every decision they make is critical to success, and contributes to moving forward.

Compare that to a more mature company. 

Instead of a handful of people, you've got a handful of departments, hierarchies within the departments, and multiple initiatives and projects going on. The costs will be much greater, but the reward will be as well. Teamwork is critical to what functionally drives the company to greater success.

When we are just starting to learn how to cook intuitively, we want to be like that startup. We want to be lean.

For me, I started learning how to intuitively cook when I simplified my meals, and drastically cut down the time that I allotted to make them. Intuition is not inborn - it is an attainable skill. It can be learned if you are consistent in practice. 

So, we're going startup-style in the kitchen.

This involves three concepts and a minimally stocked kitchen. 

The first concept deals with Parkinson's Law and is related to the simplicity mantra in my previous posts - it provides a different viewpoint on how we might look at what a "simple" dinner is. 

Parkinson's Law states that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion." If you give yourself an hour to cook dinner, the law states you're going to use up the entirety of the time (if not more). However, the opposite is the same. If you only give yourself 20 minutes to cook, keeping it simple does wonders. Keep the work simple and it takes up less time. Similarly, keep the time down, and you'll find it usually means less cooking. Either way, the restriction keeps your cooking in a well defined practice time. 20 minutes is plenty of time to develop skillage. 

The second concept deals with proper seasoning (the sprinkling of kosher salt on food). All food has its own natural taste. Salt acts as a conductor between that natural taste and your tastebuds. Too much salt and it'll taste acrid and well, salty. Too little, and your meal tastes "bland." Just right is where you want to be; this is where the flavors of the food come out. Think of a greyed-out, muted scene coming to full vibrancy and volume. 

The third concept is heat. I won't go into detail about the types of heat, just that the control is always in your hand. I can put my range to the highest setting and still not burn my meals without turning down the heat, because you can *always remove your pan* from the heat. Pans retain heat. You can always physically move them to control the burn. 

The second and third concepts are the doorway to intuitive cooking. There aren't any recipes - they're reactions to observations. If you were to summarize "how" to go about doing the second and third concepts, they're simply reactions to observations.

Observation: It tastes bland. 
Reaction: Sprinkle some kosher salt.

Observation: I'm starting to see my food burn.
Reaction: Lift the pan, toss the food, slide it over to a cool surface. 

You can chain em' now too. 

Observation: Whoa! I only have 5 minutes left to make these spiced carrots.
Reaction: Turn up the heat!
Observation: I'm starting to see my food burn. 
Reaction: Lift the pan, toss the carrots, return to the heat.
Observation: The carrots taste a little bland, and they're still a bit hard.
Reaction: Sprinkle some kosher salt. Add some water.
Observation: That's some nice coloring on the carrots. 
Reaction: Toss a couple times, off the heat, into a plate.

I've said several times before to "fuck recipes". What I didn't say, was to "always fuck recipes." Recipes actually do contain a treasure trove of information about food, where it came from, and why particular flavor combinations work. 

What recipes don't necessarily teach you is the constant acts of observing and reacting. Your ability to observe and react will "fill in the gaps". Because you are able to observe and react - it really doesn't matter if the heat was on high or medium-high, or if you put in a couple more slivers of carrot than called for. Filling in the gaps, you could say, is what is interpreted as "intuition". 

Back to the startup analogy - this time, we're going for our office. Even the most intuitive person can't cook without tools. We're going to short-list the tools you'll need to pump out 20-minute dinners. 

* a medium or large wooden chopping board
* a full-tang chef's knife 
* a sharpening steel

* a non-stick skillet
* a pot 

* salt pig with kosher salt
* olive oil with a pour spout (like what bartenders use)

That's all you need in your kitchen startup. Most apartments and homes come with an oven, but if yours doesn't, a toaster oven would do just fine. Even if you don't even have a kitchen or stove area, a hot plate in the corner can do wonders. We're not looking for fancy, just a heat source, proper prepping tools, and some cooking apparatuses.

If you've got those set up and have those concepts in mind, congratulations! You're a kitchen startup. Now the real work begins.
