- cooking as an internal reflection of your mind
- cooking angry, baking angry
- adding "love" to the food
- listen to what you are saying to yourself
- comparisons
- experiences are being boiled down to several instances
- are you too judgmental?
- all the methods individuals harangue themselves and stop themselves in their tracks even before anything is done
- attitude reframing?

"I'm just a bad cook - it's in my blood. Everytime I cook, it turns into one flaming mess, dinner goes into the trash, and it's pizza time."

There are varying degrees to this statement. Some still cook, but acknowledge their weaknesses in the kitchen.

however, just by acknowledging these weaknesses, you've set yourself at a disadvantage

We've all heard of the child's mind. To treat every encounter with wonder and curiosity. The same principle can apply here. Treat your skills and past experiences in the kitchen as a child. Successes are events, and screw-ups are also events.

The key is to turn off all judgment when looking to cook. Things aren't good or bad, right or wrong, they are what they are.

Objectively absorb observations that lead you to a different result next time.
