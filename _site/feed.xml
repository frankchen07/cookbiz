        <title>Kitchen Anxiety</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s most likely true that your chopping isn’t fast or uniform enough, that you’re probably not holding the knife right, therefore your meal never turns out right, so you overcook the wild salmon, burn the broccoli, and now have drawn the conclusion that it’s always going to be a disaster, so cooking dinner on a busy weeknight probably isn’t a great route to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you put that thought away (and breathe), my argument to you is not to talk about technique and the nitpicky details about burning your food, it is to align your mindset so that you’re more open to cook, regardless of technique. As an indirect side effect, your technique will most likely get better. That being said, you won’t find any written words in this post about how to hold a knife and make a brunoise dice. That’s a fucking terrible topic to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about kitchen performance anxiety. If I were to describe it, it would take its form as a certain clumsiness and an awkwardness in movement. There’s organizational skills, the handling of pots and pans, and knife work - all of which require dexterous fingers, precise movements, and a fluidity that is described as the “urgency” of a true cook. “He/she moves like a chef,” is the quote that comes to mind. The moving image in your head is something you probably saw on YouTube a week ago, of a seasoned, famous chef fluidly moving in kitchen through the fires, chopping furiously, all the while shouting commands and keeping the restaurant afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some extent, that colors our expectations of ourselves. We all eat out at delicious restaurants. We’ve seen the Food Network shows. We’ve seen plates topped with micro-greens and vibrant sauces with meticulously positioned lamb chops. When our output and feelings don’t measure up, we form unconscious expectations when we think about our knife skills, how something we made tasted, and what others thought of your food. Just by saying or just thinking it, the expectation has formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more dangerous things to do when starting out as a blooming home cook is to compare one’s own result to some professionally photographed recipe result, to something you ate at a restaurant last week, or to that fluidly-moving chef above. Leave professional pictures, complex recipes, and super-fluid movements for the professional cook (for now). We’re just trying to have a nice, home cooked weeknight meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To hammer home that point, understand that you most likely do not have superb photo-lighting or extreme pixel-discipline to make your home-cooked dishes look like they’re fucking glistening off the plate. Also you don’t attain a serious level of heat in a home kitchen stove, compared to a commercial stove - that’s also a constraint. Also, I forgot to mention that you don’t have a meat cook, a vegetable cook, fish station, and two people plating for you. Oh, and, all of these people have had 5+ years of experience working 364 days a year (minus Christmas), 16 hours a day, burning the hairs of their arms off. 
Your purpose and direction in YOUR kitchen at this very moment, is different. Take your current skill level and do what you can in the time period alloted. No one starts off as a hyper proficient cook. Most start off a little clumsy, they cut themselves, burn some food, under cook the meat, and obliterate the vegetables. Your first couple meals will be okay - decent and good enough to nosh on, and that, for the time being, is your bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The point of all that writing, and what you should come away with is: get into the correct head space. Be open to yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; You’re not lowering standards; you are setting no expectations, seeing where things land, and looking up from there. There’s a place in the kitchen for everyone - take action rather than letting the extremes creep into your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you “look up?” By failing. Failure is feedback. This is vital to continually raising the bar in your cooking game. &lt;strong&gt;I’ll repeat it again because it’s so important. Failure is feedback.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often finish cooking my meal, and take mental (or real paper) notes of what tastes off, what looks off, what feels off, and what smells off. Get used to taking some mental observations. At this point, you may not know what you don’t know (e.g “your sauce is too thin”, or “you didn’t balance out the acidity of the tomatoes”, or “the kale tastes like stale socks” - whatever). It doesn’t matter that you don’t know. It matters that you make the observation. They don’t have to be complex observations, either. If I want to describe my kale as it tasting like feet, I will. Take it down, and Google it later for five minutes. I guarantee Googling “my sauce is like snot,” or “my tomatoes burned the skin off my mouth” will result in something you should be doing differently next time. And next time, you will do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at that, the bar just got higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t berate myself for mistakes, nor do I distrust my own sense of taste. Nor should you. You taste what you taste, not what you think others want you to taste. This is how you develop a palate, a style, that “feeling” in cooking. You trust yourself. If it’s bitter or too salty, you will know. If not now, then later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continually raising the bar means working on your skills, one at a time. When you become a really good cook, it’s almost like conducting an orchestra. You’ve got the timing, the methods and manipulations of heat, the precise and quick knife work, the searing, the creation and layering of flavor, and the balance of taste at the end. However, it doesn’t matter until it becomes a part of you, which means, a little bit of work everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every time you cook, have in mind one concept that you want to focus on.&lt;/strong&gt; Is it curling of the fingers while chopping really fast? Getting the seasoning just right for one dish? Steaming to perfection? Do it once, and you know you can do it again. Combined with that fine observational sense of yours, and you’re already on your way. You can always build in more complexity later. When things are simple and directional, it’s clear what you’re working on and what things should taste like. There’s nothing to hide behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three concepts for you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get into the right mental space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be agnostic in your observations. Failure is feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One skill per meal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Your Brain on Cooking</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Developing a habit is psychologically tough. And doing it for something you may not like to do, or something that you find hard to do, stacks the deck against you. Although it may not sound like a traditional habit (like flossing, or brushing your teeth), cooking is certainly a habit that can be developed. It’s not just your movements and thought process during cooking, but the automatic decision you make (the habit) to pull out the pans and fire up dinner, day after day, week after week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most habits are not formed because we never give them a chance. Our mind is so fixed on the psychological, emotional, and temporal discomforts of cooking that we throw the baby (cooking) out with the bathwater (discomforts). Let’s break down the habit formation process a little bit and shift our attention to a simple physical process that can aid you in keeping the baby in the tub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all had some kind of New Year’s resolution where we want to go to the gym, get fit, get ripped, lift more, be sexy, all that shit. You’re good with it for about a week, maybe a month, but then you fail to go to the gym once, once turns to twice, twice turns into forever, and the rest of the year is a bust. What happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a combination of both accountability and discomfort. This is why people get friends to go the gym with them - for accountability, and perhaps, to distract them from the discomfort of exercise. The discomfort of any non-normal habit is the equivalent of a huge hill you have to climb for some hypothetical benefit (looking sexier or a decently delicious meal, being examples). Having an accountability partner sometimes is not enough to overcome that discomfort, but having a system in place for you to face that discomfort on even playing ground - that is what we’re going for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You ask, what is “even playing ground?” Is the reason you stopped going to the gym because of the actual discomfort of exercise, or is it the added work of getting into some gym clothes, driving your ass over to the gym, and then finally, begin working out? Most times, we’re not even aware that this “pre” work is actually the barrier to habit development. The solution? Get into your gym clothes, and just step outside. If you still feel like skipping out and going home to sleep or whatever, then fine - you can do so. That is a decision made on EVEN ground. You gave it a fighting chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same concept applies in cooking. If you buy some simple ingredients for two days of the week, you might just cook for two days of the week, simply because you made the decision physically easier. If you have your cutting board and knife already out, that also greatly increases the probability that you’ll cook that night because you are physically closer to your end goal. What happens if you just pull out the food from the fridge and laid it on your board? Again, physically easier and closer to “cooking” - and now, it would almost seem that cooking your dinner would be a faster proposition than back-stepping, putting things away, and going out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So have you actually formed a habit by executing your system? Not quite. You’re just lowering small annoying barriers that get you to your true destination. The only thing we’ve accomplished so far is making it much easier for you to cook. You’ve expended less mental energy trying to make a choice, and instead, have taken action, even if it was just a little bit. Even if you decide to put away the cooking gear, you’ve strengthened the connection in your head. &lt;strong&gt;Do this again and again, and that “call to action” of pans, knife, and board will eventually just turn into one homogeneous action: cooking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a systematic method of habit formation via decisions made through action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On your kitchen counter - your salt pig, olive oil with pour spout.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cutting board out. Knife, sharpening steel. Pans out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meat out. Vegetables out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time yourself. I gather it should take less than 1-2 minutes to perform. Do you still feel like cooking? How many more steps to a meal? Maybe some washing, some cutting, and pan heating, but you’re pretty much there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write down the same steps that you’ll repeat in the kitchen that will consistently be easy to initiate in less than a minute.&lt;/strong&gt; You can even hack it and leave your pans and cutting materials out. Don’t even put them away. That means you’re ready to meal up at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write out your process. Memorize it. Meal up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pesky Kitchen Misconceptions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Should I order out, or cook tonight?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t doubt that the probability of hearing “let’s order out” is fairly high, given packed weekday schedules, friends to catch up with, waning energy levels after work, and the other litany of activities that young professionals participate in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll state here that excuses are different than choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples of common excuses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I’m too tired.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I don’t want to do anything after work.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I don’t have time to cook after work because I have to [activity].”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I don’t want to deal with clean up.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I have money to go out and buy something delicious - fuck cooking!”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Cooking for myself is boring.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Cooking for [number of people] is exhausting.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I don’t enjoy the process of cooking enough to do it frequently.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I suck in the kitchen, everything catches on fire.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Everything I cook tastes like dog shit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list goes on. You can mix and match portions of the phrases above and find something acceptable as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you “choose not to cook” and you’ve made that a firm decision, I’m sad to hear that, but your consciously-made choice is acceptable. I certainly hope you re-evaluate down the line. However, if you “don’t want to cook because of XYZ” but have an inkling of desire to do so more frequently, you’re much closer to habitually pumping out a post-work delicious weeknight meal than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooking, like every other action that you decide to perform (either automatic or not), exists as a conscious choice in your brain at some point during the day. For busy professionals working in the Valley, convenience is generally the priority. The stomach grumbles. The brain sorts through several options. “Cook, pick-up, delivery, or starve.” I’ve been there. Whatever is close and whatever is fast is usually the go-to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we define convenience solely on the basis of time, let’s look at this hypothetically. Let us say you can actually get something on the table in 25 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to call or go online and order something and then pick it up, that’d be 2-3 minutes for the ordering process, 5-10 minutes to get there and back, and 2-3 minutes to actually do the pick-up at the restaurant. That’s pretty much 20 minutes, barring if the restaurant was close and there was no traffic. If you’re really into making that argument as strong as possible, you could’ve been filling in on that lost opportunity cost podcasting the entire time. However, in roughly the same amount of time, you could’ve cooked up something that is admittedly tasty, four times cheaper, and all the while, honed one new skill in your cooking game. Oh, and you also can podcast while cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, you can make the argument that 2-3 minutes could be spent on the phone ordering delivery and instead use your resources (read: money) to preserve your time. You get 20-25 minutes back if you don’t go out and pick anything up. Twenty minutes is twenty minutes. If you could “order” twenty minutes, would you? Probably. Whether you love cooking or hate it, if you use twenty minutes to cook, you’ve used twenty minutes. Granted, twenty minutes is not alot of time - it’s about 2% of your waking day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try and understand when people casually throw out “well, I just don’t have time to cook.” What I really hear is, “I don’t want to cook because I’d rather use my time to do [other stuff].” Earlier, we talked about cooking as a voluntary decision. The decision is either highly manual (“what should I do tonight”), or the decision-maker (you) has outsourced the decision to an automatic “no” or “yes” given a set of circumstances. In less fancy language it means, set up some kind of system that makes it an easy “yes, I’m cookin’ tonight!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to our first misconception. &lt;strong&gt;Cooking can take a long time, but it doesn’t have to - in fact, it can be as fast as ordering out.&lt;/strong&gt; Say it out loud, because you don’t hear that very often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s step into the kitchen. To make cooking work on a weeknight, three things need to exist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;food&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;20-25 minutes of your time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;passing skills in the kitchen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately, some of the responses from the anti-cooking crowd:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I don’t know what food to buy.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I don’t have 20-25 minutes of time.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Everything I cook turns out crappy and is burnt.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This list is awfully similar to the one above…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response to most cooking complaints? Misconception number two. &lt;strong&gt;Complexity is confusion. Combat it by being simple.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meals don’t have to be complex, so shopping shouldn’t be some huge sprint planning session. Additionally, professional skills in the kitchen are not a hard prerequisite to be in the kitchen. You drive a car right? Are you a professional driver? Most likely not, but you’re still on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are going to be nights when you’ve got to work overtime a bit, get to the gym, work on your side business, and still find time to cook. These are the nights that “simplicity” will allow dinner to be on the table in 20 minutes. There is no harm in making a dish that is composed of just one ingredient, seasoned well. Kale, sauteéd and seasoned. Two pork chops salted the night before, pan-fried. Some rice with a sprinkling of sesame seed. That’s it. Dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extend the second concept from meals to shopping. If your meals look like the one above, “what do I eat” doesn’t have to make coherent sense. When grocery shopping, there doesn’t need to be a mad scramble for 15 ingredients that go into one dish. Buy the vegetables you like to eat. Buy the meats you like to eat. Buy some starches and some fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplicity mantra works for kitchen techniques as well. As bad as your knife skills are, you can still probably cut your vegetables into a semi-looking dice. Same deal here. Leave the professional techniques to professional cooks for now. Start with what you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, simplicity applies to what to eat n’ buy, and using what you got. Start there, and it’ll make the apparent (but only 2% of your day) loss of time a little more bearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplicity system serves as a lowered barrier that helps you get into the habit of stepping into the kitchen. From there, understand that there is nowhere to go but up. Your fingers will only become more dexterous, your technique faster, and your meals tastier. If you can do it in 20 minutes in the first couple shots, as you level up, you can ramp up the complexity in the same amount of time. Then, imagine what you could do with &lt;em&gt;MORE&lt;/em&gt; time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third misconception. &lt;strong&gt;Remember “following a recipe?” Forget it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, if you’re being simple, you don’t even need a recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recipes (some of them, if not most) are written in a manner that expect you to follow it verbatim. Such instructions are not motivating, they’re constricting. Long list of ingredients. Longer paragraphs of instructions. More so, it’s not printed out - it’s on your computer screen, which goes to sleep every 3 minutes. Ugh, TLDR. Recipes are a cause for overwhelm because people search for things that SHOULD be good. They want food that tastes good. Food is already good - all you need is to bring it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responses from the crowd: “So what the hell do I cook?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just food. This is where some kosher salt, oil, and some garlic, acid, or herb can help. Think of kosher salt as that medium that brings out the natural flavors of the food you’re trying to cook. You’d be surprised how far a food plus some oil and salt can get you. Use it as an exercise to &lt;em&gt;REALLY&lt;/em&gt; know what the foods you like taste like. What does celery taste like? Kale? Pork loin? What is it truly like, without the sauces, mayonnaise, and condiments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep these misconceptions in mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cooking can take a long time, but it doesn’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simplicity encourages quick decisions in the hands, on the plate, and in the supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Screw the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give weeknight dinners another chance. Once, twice a week to start.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
