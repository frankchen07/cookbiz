			<p>Developing a habit is psychologically tough. And doing it for something you may not like to do, or something that you find hard to do, stacks the deck against you. Although it may not sound like a traditional habit (like flossing, or brushing your teeth), cooking is certainly a habit that can be developed. It’s not just your movements and thought process during cooking, but the automatic decision you make (the habit) to pull out the pans and fire up dinner, day after day, week after week.</p>

<p>Most habits are not formed because we never give them a chance. Our mind is so fixed on the psychological, emotional, and temporal discomforts of cooking that we throw the baby (cooking) out with the bathwater (discomforts). Let’s break down the habit formation process a little bit and shift our attention to a simple physical process that can aid you in keeping the baby in the tub.</p>

<p>We’ve all had some kind of New Year’s resolution where we want to go to the gym, get fit, get ripped, lift more, be sexy, all that shit. You’re good with it for about a week, maybe a month, but then you fail to go to the gym once, once turns to twice, twice turns into forever, and the rest of the year is a bust. What happened?</p>

<p>It’s a combination of both accountability and discomfort. This is why people get friends to go the gym with them - for accountability, and perhaps, to distract them from the discomfort of exercise. The discomfort of any non-normal habit is the equivalent of a huge hill you have to climb for some hypothetical benefit (looking sexier or a decently delicious meal, being examples). Having an accountability partner sometimes is not enough to overcome that discomfort, but having a system in place for you to face that discomfort on even playing ground - that is what we’re going for.</p>

<p>You ask, what is “even playing ground?” Is the reason you stopped going to the gym because of the actual discomfort of exercise, or is it the added work of getting into some gym clothes, driving your ass over to the gym, and then finally, begin working out? Most times, we’re not even aware that this “pre” work is actually the barrier to habit development. The solution? Get into your gym clothes, and just step outside. If you still feel like skipping out and going home to sleep or whatever, then fine - you can do so. That is a decision made on EVEN ground. You gave it a fighting chance.</p>

<p>The same concept applies in cooking. If you buy some simple ingredients for two days of the week, you might just cook for two days of the week, simply because you made the decision physically easier. If you have your cutting board and knife already out, that also greatly increases the probability that you’ll cook that night because you are physically closer to your end goal. What happens if you just pull out the food from the fridge and laid it on your board? Again, physically easier and closer to “cooking” - and now, it would almost seem that cooking your dinner would be a faster proposition than back-stepping, putting things away, and going out.</p>

<p>So have you actually formed a habit by executing your system? Not quite. You’re just lowering small annoying barriers that get you to your true destination. The only thing we’ve accomplished so far is making it much easier for you to cook. You’ve expended less mental energy trying to make a choice, and instead, have taken action, even if it was just a little bit. Even if you decide to put away the cooking gear, you’ve strengthened the connection in your head. <strong>Do this again and again, and that “call to action” of pans, knife, and board will eventually just turn into one homogeneous action: cooking.</strong></p>

<p>That is a systematic method of habit formation via decisions made through action.</p>

<p>Try it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>On your kitchen counter - your salt pig, olive oil with pour spout.</li>
  <li>Cutting board out. Knife, sharpening steel. Pans out.</li>
  <li>Meat out. Vegetables out.</li>
</ul>

<p>Time yourself. I gather it should take less than 1-2 minutes to perform. Do you still feel like cooking? How many more steps to a meal? Maybe some washing, some cutting, and pan heating, but you’re pretty much there.</p>

<p><strong>Write down the same steps that you’ll repeat in the kitchen that will consistently be easy to initiate in less than a minute.</strong> You can even hack it and leave your pans and cutting materials out. Don’t even put them away. That means you’re ready to meal up at any time.</p>

<p>Write out your process. Memorize it. Meal up.</p>
